        Although my professional career started about eight years ago,
        my passion for software development and the world of IT started much earlier.
        I was always a self-taught person, who likes to learn and pass on knowledge to others.
        That enthusiasm led me to have the opportunity to work as a teacher in two subjects of the Computer Science
        and Systems majors, at the Faculty of Computer Science, UNLP.
        I also participated in volunteers where I taught initial programming to school-age boys and girls.

        Regarding my work experience, I have been working as a Full-Stack software developer for several years.
        I have experience in various technologies, although I stand out a lot working with the MERN and MEVN stacks.
        I also lead a development team where I accompany, help and teach my teammates to maintain good practices
        development, which includes writing clean, readable, and maintainable code.
        Also in 2020 together with a colleague and friend, we founded a small company called Allusoft
        where we offer and develop appropriate solutions to the needs of each client.

        Finally I would like to comment that I live in the city of La Plata, in Buenos Aires. I have nine cats and
        I am a fan of Nintendo and Pokemon. In my free time I take the opportunity to develop some personal project.
